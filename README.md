# Runway Re-declaration System

## Project Overview:
The Runway Parameter Calculation Tool is designed to simplify the process of determining revised runway parameters in the presence of obstacles, as specified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Currently, calculating these parameters requires the independent work of two qualified individuals to ensure accuracy, followed by reconciliation of their results. This process is both complex and time-consuming.

## Objective:
To develop a tool that provides:
- [ ] Revised runway parameters based on standard runway information and obstacle data.
- [ ] A visual representation of the obstacle.
- [ ] A summary of the calculations performed.

## Features:
- [ ] Input: Standard runway information and obstacle details.
- [ ] Output: Revised runway parameters, visualisation of the obstacle, and a summary of the calculations.
- [ ] Purpose: To offer a rapid indication of the impact of an obstruction on runway parameters. This will help in making informed decisions on whether to continue operations and - [ ] evaluate the necessity of performing the official calculations as per the CAA guidelines.
- [ ] Limitations: This tool serves as an aid and guide, not a replacement for the official process. It does not replace the need for the thorough, official calculations required by regulatory authorities.
- [ ] Usage: The tool is intended for use by aviation professionals who need a quick assessment of how obstacles might affect runway parameters, assisting them in operational decision-making.
